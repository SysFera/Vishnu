.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command is used to submit a job to the specific batch scheduler associated to a machine\&. It allows describing a job in a script, using either the batch scheduler\*(Aqs directives or VISHNU\*(Aqs generic directives for all batch schedulers\&. If the machine identifier is equal to autom, the job will be automatically submitted on a best machine (for now three criterions are used: minimum number of waiting jobs, minimum number of running jobs and the total number of jobs) through the use of a script (scriptFilePath) which must be generic script using VISHNU\*(Aqs generic directives for all batch schedulers

\fB\-L \fR\fB\fIloadType\fR\fR
.RS 4
The criterion to automatically submit a job (for now three criterions are used: minimum number of waiting jobs, minimum number of running jobs and the total number of jobs)\&. This option is used only if the machine identifier is equal to autom (this keyword is used to submit automatically a job)\&. The value must be an integer\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-F \fR\fB\fIfileParams\fR\fR
.RS 4

E\&.g\&. \-\-fileParams "PFILE1=/path/to/file1 PFILE2=/path/to/file2" or \-F "PFILE1=/path/to/file1 PFILE2=/path/to/file2"\&. At the execution, the environment variable $PFILE1, for example, will point to the uploaded copy of the file /path/to/file1\&. The option \-\-fileParam or \-f allows to set each file individually\&. NOTE: The name of parameter as well as those of the corresponding environment are case\-insensitive\&. \&.
.RE
.PP

E\&.g\&. \-\-textParams "PARAM1=value1 PARAM2=value2" or \-F "PARAM1=value1 PARAM2=value2", will set the environment variables named PARAM1 and PARAM2 with value1 and value2, respectively\&. The option \-\-textParam or \-v allows to set each file individually\&. NOTE: The name of parameter as well as those of the corresponding environment are case\-insensitive\&.\&.
