.SH "NAME"
VISHNU.submitJob \- Allows to submit a job consisting in running a given script on a machine\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'ret=VISHNU\&.submitJob('u
.BI "ret=VISHNU\&.submitJob(string\ " "sessionKey" ", string\ " "scriptFilePath" ", Job\ " "jobInfo" ", SubmitOptions\ " "options\ =\ SubmitOptions()" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Command to submit a job to the specific batch scheduler associated to a machine\&. You must set a script to execute\&. It\*(Aqs possible to specify a target machine using the option \-\-machineId\&. If no machine is set, or if the specified machine is "autom", the job will be submitted on a machine automatically selected by vishnu\&. You can use the load criterion option (\-\-useLoad) to set the algorithm vishnu should select the target machine
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fIsessionKey\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. The session key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIscriptFilePath\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. The path to the file containing the characteristics (job command, and batch scheduler directive required or optional) of the job to submit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIjobInfo\fR
.RS 4
Output argument\&. The Job object containing the output information (ex: jobId and jobPath) of the job to submit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIoptions\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. Is an instance of the class SubmitOptions\&. Each optional value is associated to a set operation (e\&.g: setNbCpu(\&.\&.\&.)) in the class SubmitOptions\&. If no set operation is not called on the instance object options, the job is submitted with the options defined in the scriptFilePath\&. Otherewise the job is submitted with the optional values set by the options object and optional values defined in the scriptFilePath, but optional values set by SubmitOptions object take precedence over those in scriptFilePath\&. With in the object options or within the scriptFilePath, the last occurance of an optional value takes precedence over earlier occurance\&.
