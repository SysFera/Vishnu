.SH "NAME"
VISHNU.submitJob \- Allows to submit a job consisting in running a given script on a machine\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'ret=VISHNU\&.submitJob('u
.BI "ret=VISHNU\&.submitJob(string\ " "sessionKey" ", string\ " "machineId" ", string\ " "scriptFilePath" ", Job\ " "jobInfo" ", SubmitOptions\ " "options\ =\ SubmitOptions()" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command is used to submit a job to the specific batch scheduler associated to a machine\&. It allows describing a job in a script, using either the batch scheduler\*(Aqs directives or VISHNU\*(Aqs generic directives for all batch schedulers\&. If the machine identifier is equal to autom, the job will be automatically submitted on a best machine (for now three criterions are used: minimum number of waiting jobs, minimum number of running jobs and the total number of jobs) through the use of a script (scriptFilePath) which must be generic script using VISHNU\*(Aqs generic directives for all batch schedulers
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fIsessionKey\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. The session key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fImachineId\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. Is the id of the machine on which the job must be submitted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIscriptFilePath\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. The path to the file containing the characteristics (job command, and batch scheduler directive required or optional) of the job to submit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIjobInfo\fR
.RS 4
Output argument\&. The Job object containing the output information (ex: jobId and jobPath) of the job to submit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIoptions\fR
.RS 4
Input argument\&. Is an instance of the class SubmitOptions\&. Each optional value is associated to a set operation (e\&.g: setNbCpu(\&.\&.\&.)) in the class SubmitOptions\&. If no set operation is not called on the instance object options, the job is submitted with the options defined in the scriptFilePath\&. Otherewise the job is submitted with the optional values set by the options object and optional values defined in the scriptFilePath, but optional values set by SubmitOptions object take precedence over those in scriptFilePath\&. With in the object options or within the scriptFilePath, the last occurance of an optional value takes precedence over earlier occurance\&.

\fIerrorCode (integer)\fR
