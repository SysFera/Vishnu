.SH "NAME"
amv \- executes an asynchronous move of file\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'int\ vishnu::amv('u
.BI "int vishnu::amv(const\ string&\ " "sessionKey" ", const\ string&\ " "src" ", const\ string&\ " "dest" ", FileTransfer&\ " "transferInfo" ", const\ CpFileOptions&\ " "options\ =\ CpFileOptions()" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Initiates a move of a file or directory from the location given by the src parameter to the location given by the dest parameter\&. The src parameter must be provided in the form \*(Aqmachine_id:path\*(Aq (the machine_id values can be obtained using the vishnu_list_machine command) or \*(Aqpath\*(Aq only if the file is on the local system\&. The dest parameter must be provided in a similar way\&. Note that one of the two locations at least must be a remote location, i\&.e\&. a local move cannot be handled by this command\&. The command listFileTransfers can be used to check the status of the transfer after it is initiated, using the transfer id as the identifier\&.
