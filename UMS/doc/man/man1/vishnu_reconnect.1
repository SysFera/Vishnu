.SH "NAME"
vishnu_reconnect \- reconnects to a session that is still active
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command allows you to resume a session that has been opened previously and that has not yet been closed\&. You can disconnect from a session without closing it (for example if there are running commands in that session) by setting the session\*(Aqs close policy (at connection time) to CLOSE_ON_TIMEOUT\&. As sessions are linked to a specific client system, you cannot reconnect to a session that was opened on another client system\&. The userId and password may be given through the options, or if no userId and password are specified, vishnu_reconnect will read them in the \&.netrc file located in the home of the user\&.
