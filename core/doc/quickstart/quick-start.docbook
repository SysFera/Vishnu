    <title> User account configuration </title>
    <para>
      The VISHNU software is a part of SysFera-DS which is an open-source middleware developped by SysFera. VISHNU is primarly designed to facilitate the access to high-performance computing resources by providing the following services:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>User management services (UMS): authentication and session management.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Information management services (IMS): monitoring and control services.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Tasks management services (TMS): submission of tasks (jobs) on computing resources.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>File management services (FMS): display and transfer of files between storage resources.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The user account configuration is provided by the User Management Services.
    </para>
       	
	<section>
	  <title> User account creation </title>
	  <para>
	    The first step to access VISHNU is to request a new account to a VISHNU administrator. The only information required to create a new account is your full name and email address. You will automatically receive an email containing your userId and password.
	    When a new user account is added on VISHNU, it is possible for the user to define the mapping of her/his UNIX account by using the VISHNU local user configuration notion.
	  </para>
	</section>
		
	  <section>
	    <title> Local user configuration</title>
	    <para>  
	      To access a UNIX account on a specific machine defined on VISHNU, the user must create a local user configuration by using the 
	      <emphasis role = "bold">vishnu_add_local_account</emphasis> command. The <emphasis role = "bold">vishnu_list_machines</emphasis> command
	      gives information about the machines in which a local user configuration can be created or where a local user configuration has already been created. The information 
	      required to create a new local user configuration are: the userId, the machineId, the login of the UNIX account on the specified machine,
	      the absolute path to the user's private SSH key (used for file transfers) and the home directory path. 
	    </para>   
	    
	    <para>  
	      The ssh public key of the machine 
	      named <emphasis role="italic">&quot;userId-machineId&quot;</emphasis> is returned and stored in the $HOME/.vishnu/localAccountPublicKey/ directory
	      and must be added by the user in the ssh authorized key directory of the UNIX account.
	      Doing this allows VISHNU to be directly connected on this UNIX account, running tasks as if it was the owner of the UNIX account. With the command <emphasis role="bold">vishnu_set_ssh_key</emphasis>, the user can automatically configure the authorized_keys file of a remote account by using the ssh public key previously returned. This command uses the 
	      real hostname of the remote machine and not the VISHNU machine identifier. It also allows to remove a given public key from a remote authorized_keys file and it is possible to enable rollback in case of an inappropriate removal. Indeed, the command makes a backup of the authorized_keys file in a file named 
	      <emphasis role="italic">&quot;authorized_keys.bak&quot;</emphasis> before update it.
	    </para>

	      <para>
		<emphasis role = "bold">vishnu_add_local_account user_1 machine_1 toto ~/.ssh/id_dsa /home/toto </emphasis> (after the success of the execution of this command, the public key
		associated to the machine whose VISHNU identifier is machine_1 is returned in the following path $HOME/.vishnu/localAccountPublicKey/user_1-machine_1).
