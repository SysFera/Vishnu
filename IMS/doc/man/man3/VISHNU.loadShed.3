.SH "NAME"
VISHNU.loadShed \- sheds load on a machine
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'ret=VISHNU\&.loadShed('u
.BI "ret=VISHNU\&.loadShed(string\ " "sessionKey" ", string\ " "machineId" ", LoadShedType\ " "loadShedType" ", SupervisorOp\ " "op\ =\ SupervisorOp()" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function allows an administrator to shed load on a machine\&. Two modes are available: SOFT mode will cancel all the submitted jobs and file transfers for all VISHNU users (Note that jobs and file transfers not initiated through VISHNU will not be impacted)\&. HARD mode will additionally stop all the VISHNU processes on the machine\&. If a user without administrator rights uses this function, all the user\*(Aqs jobs and file transfers will be cancelled on the machine\&. In the HARD mode, the stopped processes will not be automatically restarted\&. Type values: HARD = 1 SOFT = 2
