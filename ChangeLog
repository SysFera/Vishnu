+----------------------+
| VISHNU 3.0.0 - Beta2 |
+----------------------+
* Added beta support for submitting jobs to a Cloud, using DeltaCloud
  (tested with OpenStack only). Currently, only the Vishnu user is
  used, there is no user switch during submission. The credentials
  need to be provided to VISHNU though an configuration file,
  options, or environment variables.
* /!\ The database needs to be updated using scripts in
  core/database/database_update_addvminfo_*.sql
* /!\ The compilation process has been updated: you can now compile the
  client CLI and the servers separately
* Automtests have been updated: they do not launch the Vishnu platform,
  they use an already deployed one.
* fixed a bug where signal-interrupted zmq calls (EINTR) were not
  handled properly
* fixed a bug on the "POSIX" backend where the wallclock time was not
  correctly handled which caused submission scripts to sometimes be
  deleted before being executed.
* Files necessary to build vishnu java library have been included in this
  repository. Currently there is no doc for this, see
  scripts/ALL_prepareScript.sh if you want the lib.

* WS are abandoned, they won't be maintained anymore. Related files and
	directories have been removed.
* Java APIs are available
* Vishnu does not rely on DIET anymore. All communications are handled by
	ZMQ. SeDs only require 1 open port to communicate (easier for
	deployments)
* TMS now uses FMS to send input files to jobs. You can use remote files
	as input files.
* A new daemon has been introduced: the dispatcher which serves as a proxy
	between clients and SeDs
* Several bugs closed: #449, #452, #453, #225, #409, #344, #291, #289,
