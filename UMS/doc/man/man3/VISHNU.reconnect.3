.SH "NAME"
VISHNU.reconnect \- reconnects to a session that is still active by trying multiple couples (userId, password) each in turn
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'ret=VISHNU\&.reconnect('u
.BI "ret=VISHNU\&.reconnect(ListUsers\ " "listUsers" ", string\ " "sessionId" ", Session\ " "session" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command allows you to resume a session that has been opened previously and that has not yet been closed\&. You can disconnect from a session without closing it (for example if there are running commands in that session) by setting the session\*(Aqs close policy (at connection time) to CLOSE_ON_TIMEOUT\&. As sessions are linked to a specific client system, you cannot reconnect to a session that was opened on another client system\&. The vishnu_reconnect_m tries in turn multiple couples (userId, password)\&.
